<h1>*what are viruses?*</h1>
<p> Viruses are microscopic parasites that lack the capacity to thrive and reproduce outside of a host body..</p>

</html>

<h1>*The structure and types of Corona viruses?* </h1>
<p>The simplest virions consist of two basic components: nucleic acid (single- or double-stranded RNA or DNA) and a protein coat, the capsid, which functions as a shell to protect the viral genome from nucleases and which during infection attaches the virion to specific receptors exposed on the prospective host cell.</p>

<h1>*Have Corona viruses affected and impacted human lives in the past?*
</h1>
<p>Corona has made a huge impact on various aspects of human life around the world and different hypotheses have been put forward for future life. Coronavirus is an epidemic that has not only affected human health and social relations but has also changed other important areas of life. Are their work and social conditions for the long term or not? Now, several months after the spread of the coronavirus in the world, people with an unprecedented history of the virus are finding themselves under the influence of a pervasive virus in the world. Through the study, an attempt has been made to highlight the impact of the COVID-19 on human social life.</p>

<h1>*The year in which the Coronavirus pandemic started?*</h1>
<p>It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009</p>

<h1>*The difference between an epidemic and a pandemic?*</h1>
<p>AN EPIDEMIC is a disease that affects a large number of people within a community, population, or region.
A PANDEMIC is an epidemic that’s spread over multiple countries or continents.</p>

<h1>*Symptoms of Covid-19 infection?*</h1>
<p>Most common symptoms:
fever
dry cough
tiredness
Less common symptoms:
aches and pains
sore throat
diarrhoea
conjunctivitis
headache
loss of taste or smell
a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
Serious symptoms:
difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
chest pain or pressure
loss of speech or movement
Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>

<h1>*Number of deaths caused by Covid-19 in 2020, in different countries or
territories of the world?*</h1>
<p>in maharashtra=2.50%
in kerala=0.40%
in karnataka=1.30%
in tamil nadu=1.47%</p>

<h1>*Which countries were least affected and why?*
</h1>
<p>Vanuatu

Vanuatu has reported only one coronavirus disease case till date, a 23-year-old American tourist who tested positive on November 10. Vanuatu imposed domestic and international travel restrictions after the American national tested positive and extended the necessary quarantine period from 14 t0 28 days.

According to the island nation’s English newspaper the Daily Post on Wednesday, Vanuatu’s Prime Minister Bob Loughman said the nation has contained its first Covid-19 case after test results from the first Covid-19 patient sent to Australia for further examination came back negative.

Samoa

The Pacific nation of Samoa reported its first case of coronavirus disease in November according to The Guardian, after reporting zero cases for 11 months since the pandemic started. The Samoan national who tested positive had been brought back home on a repatriation flight from Australia and the second case was detected within days. It was another sailor who had travelled on a repatriation flight from New Zealand. Both have since recovered, according to worldometer.


Wallis and Futuna

The French Polynesian nation of Wallis and Futuna officially reported its first case of Covid-19 in October. Patient zero was reported to be asymptomatic by state media. On November 12 and 24, the second and third cases were reported taking the total to three. Patient zero has since then recovered, according to worldometer. The state authorities moved swiftly and imposed restrictions on travelling. Only travellers who can prove that entry is for urgent family/work reasons were allowed to enter Wallis and Futuna. They were expected to complete a travel certificate, stating that they do not have any coronavirus disease-related symptoms or have been in contact with anyone who has exhibited said symptoms.

Marshall Islands

Like most Pacific islands the Marshall Islands too closed its borders in March to protect its population from the coronavirus disease. In October, two cases were detected in a US military base after a man and a woman tested positive. They flew in from Hawaii on a military plane and were asymptomatic, according to the BBC.


Anguilla

Anguilla reported its first cases of Covid-19 as early as March when an American woman and an Anguillan man who had been in contact with each other tested positive. Since then, 10 coronavirus disease cases have been reported, and seven people have recovered so far, according to worldometer. Anguilla’s health infrastructure is terribly underfunded hence the Caribbean island has been on high alert since March.

Western Sahara

Western Sahara has reported 10 cases of Covid-19 so far and one fatality. Eight people have also reportedly recovered, according to worldometer.

Montserrat

The Caribbean island of Montserrat reported 13 cases of Covid-19, with the first case reported as early as March. So far, 12 cases have witnessed a full recovery and one death, that of a 92-year-old woman, has been recorded in the island, according to worldometer. </p>

<h1>*What precautions should the survivors of Covid- 19 take over the next two
years to reduce the co-mortality rate?*</h1>
<p>i}maintain a safe distance
ii}wash your hands when you come from outside
iii}wear a mask
</p>

<h1>*How can we prepare ourselves for the next pandemic on a local as well as
global scale?*</h1>
<p>in local scaleas giving free mask to those people who are not wearing the mask and on global level put banners for the update of anything about situation </p>

<h1>*What is mutation? How does the virus mutation affect the rate of infection and
mortality?*</h1>
<p>A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses.
                 The Effect of Cellular Factors on Virus Mutation Rate
The cellular environment can impact virus mutation rates and frequency. For example, dNTP pool imbalances can affect retrovirus mutation rates [58], and it has been suggested that differences in substitution rates between RNA viruses is a consequence of differences in virus RNA synthesis rates in different cell types [59]. In addition to these effects, there are also cellular factors that can result in increased mutation in RNA viruses. Adenosine-to-inosine modification by enzymes called adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) is the most common form of RNA base modification that occurs in mammals. A-to-I conversion has important consequences in the coding potential of substrate RNAs, as inosine is decoded as a G by polymerases during template copying. The A-to-I conversion in a dsRNA duplex also has consequences to stability of RNA secondary structures, as the A:I pairing is less stable than a canonical A:U pair. This can have important consequences for RNAs that depend on their structure rather than sequence for their function [60]. ADAR modification of cellular double-stranded RNA was shown to prevent its recognition by the cytoplasmic sensor of nonself RNAs that would otherwise lead to chronic activation of innate immune pathways [61]. There is also evidence that ADAR can modify viral RNAs. Sequence analysis of RNA virus genomes has revealed that they preferentially accumulate A-to-G transitions, which are characteristic hallmarks of ADAR activity. Measles virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus, responsible for an acute disease predominantly in infants, but in rare instances associated with a fatal latent infection of the CNS known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Analysis of measles virus genomes from SSPE victims has revealed abundant A-to-G transitions, suggesting a role for ADAR in establishment of SSPE [62]. Consistent with an antiviral role for ADAR, measles virus infection of ADAR knock-out cell lines displayed increased cellular pathology, and similar findings were reported for other RNA viruses, implicating ADAR as a cellular restriction factor for a wide range of negative-stranded RNA viruses [63]. Direct evidence of ADAR modification of a viral RNA genome comes from studies of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is the smallest of the RNA viruses and encodes just two proteins, HDAg-L and HDAg-S, both of which are essential for virus viability. HDAg-L and HDAg-S share the same amino terminal open reading frame, but HDAg-L possesses a carboxyl terminal extension that is accessed when the stop codon at the end of the HDAg-S ORF is bypassed. Early during infection only the truncated HDAg-S is expressed, but then at later times expression of HDAg-L increases due to the site-specific modification of the stop codon by ADAR [64]. This editing event is highly specific and is promoted by the highly secondary structured HDV RNA genome. This action by ADAR is clearly proviral, in that without the activity of ADAR, no infectious HDV particles would form.

Another family of cellular factors that can modify the sequence of viral genomes is the APOBEC family of enzymes. These comprise an extensive arm of the innate immune system [65]. They are responsible for the modification by deamination of cytosine residues to uracil, which is an activity largely performed on single-stranded DNA substrates, leading to the phenomenon of hypermutation. APOBEC activity can affect the retroviruses. HIV infection is blocked by APOBEC, unless it expresses the viral infectivity factor (Vif). The mechanism for this blockade relies on the packaging of multiple APOBEC family members within HIV virions, which can act on the HIV genome once it has been copied by reverse transcriptase into a complementary DNA. The effect of APOBEC activity can be the modification of up to 10% of susceptible cytosine residues, resulting in a drop in infectivity of up to 100-fold</p>

<h1>*What possible mutations of Covid-19 may occur in future and what could be the
possible impact? What steps can be taken to minimize the impact of these
mutations?*
</h1>
<p>yes the corona can occur in future years also as now also after so many months the corona strain has not gone and new strain is occuring so it can occur in further also and its impact can be more sevior than now and we should take precautions as proper hand sanitazion wearing mask keeping safe distance can save you from corona in further years </p>
